                                        <p class="card-text"> This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
                                            The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is
                                            now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
                                            person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are
                                            highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.
                                            The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and
                                            sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected
                                            geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected
                                            with
                                            the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where
                                            they
                                            became infected.

                                        <p class="card-text">The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person.
                                            Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to
                                            others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated
                                            either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are)
                                            until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
                                            How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when
                                            to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in
                                            consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts,
                                            and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each
                                            situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms,
                                            and results of laboratory testing for that patient.
                                            Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from
                                            isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the
                                            following requirements.
                                            The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing
                                            medications.
                                            The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
                                            The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive
                                            respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.
                                            Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to
                                            pose a risk of infection to others.</p>

                                                stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease.
                                                Formerly,
                                                this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or
                                                “2019-nCoV”.

                                                There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that
                                                commonly
                                                cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new

                                                seen
                                                in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World

                                                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in

                                                This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
                                                The
                                                first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus
                                                is
                                                now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
                                                person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are
                                                highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                                                The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and
                                                sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected
                                                geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected
                                                with
                                                the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where
                                                they
                                                became infected.

                                                Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to
                                                others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated
                                                either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are)

                                                they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

                                                How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when

                                                release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in
                                                consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts,

                                                public health officials and involves considering specifics of each
                                                situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms,

                                                following requirements:

                                                The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing

                                                on the WHO website and through your national and local public health
                                                authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of

                                                and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other

                                                You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19
                                                by
                                                taking some simple precautions:
                                                <br>
                                                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
                                                rub
                                                or wash them with soap and water.<br>
                                                Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based
                                                hand
                                                rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<br>
                                                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                                                anyone
                                                who is coughing or sneezing.<br>
                                                Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets
                                                from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too
                                                close,
                                                you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the
                                                person coughing has the disease.<br>
                                                Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.<br>
                                                Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
                                                contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or
                                                mouth.
                                                From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.<br>
                                                Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory
                                                hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent
                                                elbow or
                                                tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
                                                immediately.<br>
                                                Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene
                                                you
                                                protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and
                                                COVID-19.<br>
                                                Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
                                                difficulty
                                                breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the
                                                directions of your local health authority.<br>
                                                Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                                                information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
                                                allow
                                                your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health
                                                facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of
                                                viruses
                                                and other infections.<br>
                                                Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
                                                areas
                                                where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to
                                                places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes,
                                                heart
                                                or lung disease.<br>
                                                Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these
                                                areas.

                                                normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of

                                                temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with
                                                extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way

                                                protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your
                                                hands.
                                                By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and
                                                avoid
                                                infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and
                                                nose.
